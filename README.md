========================================
Brain Damage API - BDAPI - Version 0.6.0
========================================

Currently for demonstration purposes only.


============
Dependencies
============

The BDAPI currently requires a number of ZLIB and BSD licensed dependencies for compilation, some of which are intended to be eliminated in time. As all of the BDAPI's dependencies are based on liberal licenses, programs making use of the BDAPI do not require the inclusion of any dynamic link libraries. Currently the BDAPI requires the following third party libraries to compile:

* Boost 1.55.0          - http://www.boost.org/
* Bullet Physics 3.0    - https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/
* GLEW 1.10.0           - http://glew.sourceforge.net/
* GraphicsMagick 1.3.19 - http://www.graphicsmagick.org/
* PDCurses 3.4          - http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/
* SDL 2.0.1             - https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php/
* SDL Mixer 2.0.0       - http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* STK 4.5.0             - https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/
* ZLIB 1.2.8            - http://www.zlib.net/


==================
Build Environments
==================

The BDAPI has been successfully compiled with both MINGW and MSVC, however, it can in theory be built in Macintosh and Linux environments without too much trouble.
